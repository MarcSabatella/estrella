Initial impression

Mozart(http://www.mozart.co.uk/) should reproduce this one straightforwardly.

Now I wouldn't necessarily do things in this order, but I can build up a score in a manner suggested by the instructions, using the following procedure:


1 Create a new pice using Paino Solo template in 3/4 and 4 flats.   See MozartChallenge02-v1.pdf

On the bass stave set default stem directions of the two supplied strands to down and up (envisaging the crotchets in the first bar to be on one strand and the minim in the first bar to be on the other).

2. Type in a single line of music on the treble staff.  Note that I can't get the top C in.  Do not worry about spacing or stem directions.  See MozartChallenge02-v2.pdf

3. Increase the writable space above/below the staff so I can get top C in.  Add the remaining notes on the treble staff.  NB stem directions, and tie bow directions sort themselves out automatically.  See MozartChallenge02-v3.pdf

4. Put the crotchets in the bass line.  (Let the spacing sort itself out, and don't worry about phrasing at this stage.)  See MozartChallenge02-v4.pdf

5. Put the final strand on the bass stave, offsetting minims as we go along to avoid colisions. See MozartChallenge02-v5.pdf

6. Go through inserting dynamics, accents, phrase marks, text, and edit titles. See MozartChallenge02-v6.pdf

7. At this stage the note spacing isn't ideal, but then I haven't actually done anything about it explicitly.   Rather than respace individual notes I now edit the layout, reducing left and right margins to be roughly the same as the original (on my A4 print-out), and add an indent to the first line.  The soft line breaks readjust themselves.  I now add hard line breaks at the points where the line breaks in the original were, and the automatic justification mechanism takes care of the spacing. So I arrive at my 'finished' result:  MozartChallenge02-v7.pdf
