# openLilyLib Engraving Challenges

## Challenge #01 - Schumann: Carnaval

### MuseScore 1.3

This document will be the report of tackling the Schumann challenge
with the stable version of
[MuseScore 1.3](http://musescore.org)
I'm working on a small netbook with no mouse, so I might be slower than being on a big workstation, but that's my problem :)

#### Analysis
- I usually don't do thorough analysis of scores with MuseScores, just start engraving.
- But looking at the score I cannot find anything which is not supported out-of-the box by MuseScore or needs some clever trick.
