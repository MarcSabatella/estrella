# Schumann - Estrella
## v2.1
### Initial Remarks
Within this version, I will be addressing the layout of the page and the staff size.

### Process
Finale is well tuned for this process. Initially, all one has to do is choose `page layout tool` to get to the appropriate menues to adjust everything. This part is simple, and it is just a few menu selects away.

For editing the actual document's size and line breaks, I will have to go from `page layout tool` to the selector. To get the line breaks, I selected one of the containing measures and pressed `ctrl + up/down` to get the page to display the way I wanted.

Total time elapsed for this process: 00:05:00
