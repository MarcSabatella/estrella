### Initial thoughts
For this challenge, I will resolve various idiosyncrasies such as the "Score" mark at the top of the page, the page numbers (if any) and the measure numbers (to reflect the original score as best as possible).

### Process
The edits are made with the selection tool. Once you select an object of text, you can delete by pressing `DELETE` or right clicking the object and selecting from the drop down menu what you wish to do.

Time elapsed for this process: 00:01:00
