### Slurs, Articulations, Dynamics


----------
#### Initial modifications
The default document font I was using was awful. I don't like the Maestro font system, but I realize now that I *really* don't like the Engraver Font.

So, I went to `Document` and then `>Select Default Music Font` and reverted the font.


----------
#### Slurs

I used the simple entry method. I had to double click (with the `slur` tool marked) and "drag" whilst selecting the notes. The automatic behaviors are erradic, and will need further tweaking. Especially:

 1. Default slur positions are not behaving in the manner which would be conducive to reading the score.
 2. Slur arcs are erradic.
 3. There is some interference with other objects on the page. 

Of course all of this will have to be adjusted.

 
Time elapsed - 7:30 min.


----------
#### Miscellaneous Information

I needed to add various tempo indications, as well as remove the default engraver of the original tempo marking. There is no "clear" way to input special Roman characters, such as the "Ã¹." I had to search it out on the character map.

Time elapsed - 3:40 min.


----------
#### Articulations

My, Finale is being difficult at this juncture. The default behavior of the placement of the articulations is difficult. It will take lots of tweaking (maybe there are some shortcuts that I've forgotten about). But, in the interest of fairness and transparency, I'll make a few observations:

 1. The default placement of an articulation seems to be down (or below).
 2. There is an auto adjusting mouse that flips between the upper and lower staff. This isn't usually a problem... unless you are trying to write, oh let's say, third measure from the end of the third system, `l.h.` Then it is extraordinarily annoying.
 2. Articulations ignore the presence of other musical elements
 3. It is going to take a lot of individual tweaking, but again I will probably dig up some useful shortcuts.

As I'm doing this project, I'm beginning to see that Finale "boasts" in the things it ought to take more interest in, such as some of the idiosyncrasies and defaults. Nevertheless, I'm looking forward to the tweaking stages of this task.


----------
#### Dynamics, Hairpins

These were fairly straightforward though they do not align as tightly to the staff as they ought. Again, another moment to think about all the tweaking needed to bring this to "publication quality."


----------
### Final Remarks
In this version, many things are becoming quite clear:

 - Finale is terrible (or purposefully ignorant) of the *where* and *when* things should be placed.
 - All other thoughts aside, I feel my work is cut out for me, after putting all the notes in.
 - It must have been a "cinch" to put this together on a polished lead-plate using a rasp/nib tool set.

### Next things that need to happen (TODO):

 - adjust global `staff size`
 - remove (hide) various `voice` idiosyncrasies
 - adjust the displacement and behavior of `articulations` and `dynamics`
 - fix phrasing `slurs`
 - fix any voice properties

And even after all this is done, there is still a lot of work to be done...
