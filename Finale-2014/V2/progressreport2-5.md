# Schumann - Estrella
## v2.5
### Initial thoughts
For this portion, I am going to fix cautionary accidentals (if any) and hide unnecessary rests to better reflect the original score. I am also going to flip the slurs (without modifying the shapes) of various mismatches with the original score.

I will also be checking to make sure initial articulations and slurs and dynamics are in place

### Process
Finale distinguishes between cautionary accidentals and repeated accidentals within a key signature (that do no otherwise require it). Luckily, this is under the `Plug-ins` menu, and it is very easy to get to. First one must highlight the measures in question (for cautionary accidentals) and select the appropriate palette within the `Plug-ins` menu.

Time Elapsed for this process: 00:05:00

> I had a small hitch with the editing, and I decided to go with it... the plug-in decided, against my ordering, to go ahead and set cautionary accidentals for the rest of the piece for the second voice. That was a nuisance.

The next thing I did was check the slur directions. The only places where I saw that problem were in the last measures.

Time Elapsed: 00:01:00

To hide the rests, it was done with `simple entry tool` using the `H` key to hide notes.

Time elapsed: 00:06:00

### Final thoughts

This was a simple and straightforward process. However, I did feel a little tension between the way Finale wanted to behave and what I wish I could 'just do.' There are still many things left to do, but this atleast levels the playing field a little better.
