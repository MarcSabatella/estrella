Schumann's _Estrella_ from _Carnaval op. 9_
-------------------------------------------

The goal of this particular challenge is not only to test engravers
and their programs, but also the rules and workflows of the contest itself.
Therefore we have deliberately picked a fairly straightforward piece:
it is short enough to be engraved in whole and consists mostly of quite
simple notation.  However, do not underestimate it!  Submissions that
we had already received show that there are a few challenging elements
which some programs have difficulty with.  So, it should be an excellent
warm-up piece.

You can find the score in the [estrella.png](estrella.png) file.
