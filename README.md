Schumann's _Estrella_ from _Carnaval op. 9_
-------------------------------------------

Since the goal of this particular challenge is not only to test engravers
and their programs, but also the rules and workflows of the contest itself,
we have deliberately picked a fairly straightforward piece.
It is short enough to be engraved in whole and consists mostly of quite
simple notation.  However, do not underestimate it!  Submissions that
we had already received show that there are a few challenging elements
which some programs have difficulty with.  So, it should be an excellent
warm-up piece.

**Important:** please make sure you read the [instructions](http://github.com/engraving-challenges/main/blob/master/README.md#instructions) before starting work!

You can find the score in the [estrella.png](estrella.png) file.

Please remember: this is a challenge and only partly a contest. There is no deadline.
The point is to try creating the most beautiful engraving with notation package of your choice,
and document your progress on your way there.

for participants, please refer to the
