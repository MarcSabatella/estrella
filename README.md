### Engraving Challenges

This is an open contest in music engraving; it's aim is to
test music notation software in controlled conditions.

Schumann's _Estrella_ from _Carnaval op. 9_
-------------------------------------------

Since the goal of this particular challenge is not only to test engravers
and their programs, but also the rules and workflows of the contest itself,
we have deliberately picked a fairly straightforward piece.
It is short enough to be engraved in whole,
it does *not* pose real engraving difficulties but *still* has some basic challenges
built-in, such as polyphonic settings and a rather large number of articulations.

**Important:** please make sure you read the [instructions](http://github.com/engraving-challenges/main/blob/master/README.md#instructions) before starting work!

You can find the score in the [estrella.png](estrella.png) file.

Please remember: this is a challenge and only partly a contest. There is no deadline.
The point is to try creating the most beautiful engraving with notation package of your choice,
and document your progress on your way there.

For general information on the challenges as well as specific instructions
for participants, please refer to the
